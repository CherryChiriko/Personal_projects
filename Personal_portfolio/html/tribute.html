        <h2> Quotes </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>“As time goes by without anyone eating it, it starts getting dry and looking anything but appetizing, and no one’s willing to make a move, but when the busboy takes it you go ‘wait, we’re not done with that yet.’ kinda on reflex. But then you end up leaving without eating it.”</li>
          <li>“I had a feeling I saw a girl in a sailor uniform with a machine gun walk by.”</li>
          <li>“Raise your hand if you thought of something naughty!”</li>
          <li>“Sounds like a lot of work, I think I’ll pass. I’d rather play and I’ll ask for help when I get stuck.” </li>
          <li>“And the TV show ended by saying how young people are becoming increasingly illiterate, but doesn’t browsing the Internet and blogging actually improve your literacy?” </li>
          <li>“How come you wear glasses? I mean, you’re really pretty but you can only appeal to a tiny section of the fanbase.”</li>
          <li>“A great man once said that UFO catchers are like savings account.”</li>
